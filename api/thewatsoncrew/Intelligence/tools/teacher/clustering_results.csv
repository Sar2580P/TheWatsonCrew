If you are diagnosed with diabetes, be assured that your doctor’s first aim is to reduce or prevent the impacts of insulin resistance in the body. Indulging in physical activities like yoga and exercising improves the body’s insulin sensitivity, thereby improving the cell’s efficacy to metabolize blood glucose into energy.

Regulates Blood Sugar Levels: Curry leaves for diabetes contain compounds that help lower blood glucose levels by affecting insulin activity and glucose metabolism. Curry leaves lower both fasting sugar levels and postprandial sugar levels.
Improves Insulin Sensitivity: These leaves enhance insulin sensitivity, making cells more responsive to insulin, and thereby aiding better glucose utilization.
