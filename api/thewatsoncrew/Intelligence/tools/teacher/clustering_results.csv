Type-2 diabetes is primarily a lifestyle disorder, one that gets worse with the increase of insulin resistance in the body.

If you are diagnosed with diabetes, be assured that your doctor’s first aim is to reduce or prevent the impacts of insulin resistance in the body. Indulging in physical activities like yoga and exercising improves the body’s insulin sensitivity, thereby improving the cell’s efficacy to metabolize blood glucose into energy.
