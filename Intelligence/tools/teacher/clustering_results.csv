102,2,77,1,"Now, because the model produces the outputs one at a time, we can assume that the model is selecting the word with the highest probability from that probability distribution and throwing away the rest. That’s one way to do it (called greedy decoding). Another way to do it would be to hold on to, say, the top two words (say, ‘I’ and ‘a’ for example), then in the next step, run the model twice: once assuming the first output position was the word ‘I’, and another time assuming the first output position was the word ‘a’, and whichever version produced less error considering both positions #1 and #2 is kept. We repeat this for positions #2 and #3…etc.","{'imgs': 'https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_trained_model_probability_distributions.png\nhttps://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png', 'key_words': '', 'external_ref': '', 'source': 'https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/', 'rank': 77, 'document_label': 1}"
