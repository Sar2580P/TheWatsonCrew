As a person learns to perform a task correctly by acknowledging his mistakes, similarly an AI agent can also learn to perform a task correctly by acknowledging its mistakes.

Below is the user query AI agent is trying to solve:
USER_QUERY : {input}

Below is one of the past mistake made by AI agent on some other user query:
MISTAKE : {mistake}

- You need to check if the above mistake is relevant to the current user query or not. 
- Whether the AI agent should use this mistake as experience while solving the current user query or not.

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS :
- Return 1 if the above mistake is relevant to the current user query, else return 0.
- Stick to the above information provided, decide importance of mistake judiciously, don't pollute the information.

MISSED_TOOL_TEMPLATE = '''
There is an AI agent which is picking up tools under ReAct framework to solve user queries.
It misses picking up correct tool, being unable to reason out its usage for the given query.

I provide you some few shots how to reason out the mistake highlight of a tool based on the user query and tool description:

Example_Query : "Prioritize my p0 issues"
Tools missed: 
Incorrect tool uses:
Example_MISTAKE : "The tool 'who_am_i' is useful as there is a keyword 'my' which hints towards the user currently logged in. So, this tool can get the user id of the user currently logged in." 

Example_Query : "Summarize high severity tickets from the customer UltimateCustomer"
Tools missed:
Incorrect tool uses:
Example_MISTAKE :"We need to find the id of the object, so we must use the tool 'search_object_by_name' tool which searches for the object id based on the name of the object."


Example_Query : "What are my all issues in the triage stage under part FEAT-123? Summarize them"
Tools missed:
Incorrect tool uses:
Example_MISTAKE :"We need to find the id of the object, so we must use the tool 'search_object_by_name' tool which searches for the object id based on the name of the object."

- You need to provide an eye-catchy insight of why that tool should not be missed for the given query based on the user query and tool description. 
- You insight will help the agent to learn from its mistakes. Don't be super-specific to user query, keep the tool description in consideration. 
- Keep your insight within 20 words and at least 9 words. Present answer in a paragraph.

Your task is to extract the argument value from user query based on argument description and argument type.

The datatype is {arg_dtype}

The argument description is:
{arg_description}

The above mentioned arguments have their values present in the query. You need to extract the argument value from the query.
Don't pollute the information, stick to information provided in the user query.

Your query is:
{user_query}

FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS --->
  - Don't return anything else other than the argument value.
  - Ensure that the argument value is in correct data type before returning.
  - If the argument value is not explicitly present in the query, then return "NONE".

ANSWER :
'''

# ALERT !!!
# - If the Query contains specific keywords like $$PREV[i], where i is the index of the output you want to use, 
#           then it is a symbolic representation of the output and is NOT THE ACTUAL OUTPUT
# - use $$PREV[i] as whole and don't pass invalid representation like "$$PREV" OR "$$PREV[]" or i

ARG_FILTER_PROMPT = '''
I want to use a tool which has a lots of arguments. I want to filter out only those arguments which can surely be extracted from the user query.

Below I provide the arguments that the tool can take along with their description:
{arg_description}

{format_instructions}

Below I provide the query, which needs to be referenced whiele deciding which arguments to filter out:
QUERY : {query}

ALERT !!!
- Don't create any new argument from user query, make sure that filtered argument have correct name.
- If the Query contains specific keywords like $$PREV[i], then take it as a whole.
- Stick to information provided in the user query and description of arguments.
- Don't pollute the argument filtering with any assumptions.
- Make sure that there are no parsing errors.
'''

#____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

LOGICAL_TEMPLATE = '''
You need to return a code block executing the above user query in the python.

Below I provide an example code block in python so that you know the desired output format:
Example 1:
```
### Query: Calculate the difference in count between P1 and P2 issues

def count_difference(p1_issues, p2_issues):
    return len(p1_issues) - len(p2_issues)
count_difference("$$PREV[0]", "$$PREV[1]")
```

Example 2:
```
### Query: Extract the first five tasks from the list of all tasks.

def first_five_tasks(tasks):
    return tasks[:5]

first_five_tasks("$$PREV[0]")
```
(note that there were other tool calls before this as well that were ommitted)

You may devise any function of your own using a combination of sum, variables, loops, if-else statements etc.

- Make sure that the code is in correct syntax before returning.
- Don't return anything else other than the code block. 
- Simply return the code block, nothing else to be returned

You have the following user query:
{query}
